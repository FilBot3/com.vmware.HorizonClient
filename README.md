# VMWare Horizon Client Flatpak

## Overview

This is a Flatpak build of the VMWare Horizon Client for Linux x86_64 systems.
I did see [an unanswered call on the VMWare forums](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/Horizon-Desktops-and-Apps/Package-VMWare-Horizon-View-as-a-Flatpak/m-p/501293)
for a Flatpak offering of the software. Since it's a GUI based tool, why not
put it into a Flatpak?
